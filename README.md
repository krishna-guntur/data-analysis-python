# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Python  

This repository documents my learning journey in **Data Analysis with Python**, focusing on mastering the core libraries widely used in data science and analytics.  

## ðŸ”§ Libraries & Tools  
- **NumPy** â†’ Numerical computing, arrays, linear algebra, and mathematical operations  
- **Pandas** â†’ Data wrangling, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** â†’ Data visualization with customizable plots and charts  
- **Seaborn** â†’ Statistical data visualization with beautiful, high-level graphics  
- *(More libraries and concepts to be added as I progress!)*  

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Build a strong foundation in Python-based data analysis  
- Practice real-world datasets for cleaning, transforming, and visualization  
- Develop reusable notebooks and scripts for reference and projects  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
ðŸ“¦ data-analysis-python
- ðŸ“‚ notebooks/ â†’ Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step practice
- ðŸ“‚ datasets/ â†’ Sample datasets used for analysis
- ðŸ“‚ scripts/ â†’ Python scripts for automation and reusable functions
